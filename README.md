### How to start the project

1. Clone the repo
2. Cd into the repo
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the application

### Some decisions taken

1. I do not have a payed plan of `sketch`, and therefore couldn't access the exact design for the measurments, so I had infer them based on visual properties. I added more information on the email

### Used technologies

1. The application uses `create react app` with `typescript`, Typescript helps uphold a strong type system in order to minimize bugs in the system
2. The major reason for using `react` is because it is a simple library and one that I am very experienced using
3. The application uses code-quality tools like `eslint` and `prettier` for code-formatting and wraning about duplicates, syntax errors e.t.c
